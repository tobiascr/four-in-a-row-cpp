A four in a row game programmed with C++. It is developed for Linux. It can
compute moves to full depth and can make perfect moves.

I uses bitboards, negamax, alpha beta pruning, transposition table,
iterative deepening, move sorting based on heuristics, and an opening book.

To compile the program run make. Then type ./four_in_a_row_command_line to run it.
